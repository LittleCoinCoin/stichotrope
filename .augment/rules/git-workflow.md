# GIT WORKFLOW GUIDELINES

## CORE PRINCIPLES

### 1. Single Logical Change Per Commit

Each commit addresses exactly one logical change with clear rationale, enabling precise rollback capabilities and traceable development history.

### 2. Conventional Commit Format

Standardized commit messages for automated tooling integration and clear communication.

### 3. Development Narrative

Commit history tells a coherent story of development progress and decision-making.

---

## CONVENTIONAL COMMIT FORMAT

### Structure

```plaintext
<type>[optional scope]: <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

### Types

- **feat**: New features (triggers minor version bump)
- **fix**: Bug fixes (triggers patch version bump)
- **docs**: Documentation changes
- **refactor**: Code refactoring without functional changes
- **test**: Adding or updating tests
- **chore**: Maintenance tasks, dependency updates
- **ci**: Changes to CI/CD configuration
- **perf**: Performance improvements
- **style**: Code style changes (formatting, etc.)

### Examples from Wobble Implementation

```plaintext
# Feature implementation
feat: add threaded file writer with queue-based operations

## COMMIT STRATEGY PLANNING

### Before Starting Work

**1. Logical Change Identification**:

- Break down work into single-purpose changes
- Identify dependencies between changes
- Plan commit sequence for logical progression

**2. Rollback Strategy**:

- Ensure each commit can be safely reverted
- Avoid commits that break functionality
- Plan for partial rollback scenarios

**3. Message Planning**:

- Prepare clear, descriptive commit messages
- Identify scope and type for each change
- Plan body content for complex changes

### During Development

**1. Incremental Commits**:

- Commit frequently with small, focused changes
- Validate functionality after each commit
- Maintain working state at every commit

**2. Commit Message Quality**:

- Write clear, concise descriptions
- Explain the "why" not just the "what"
- Include context for future developers

**3. Scope Management**:

- Keep changes within defined scope
- Avoid mixing unrelated changes
- Create separate commits for different concerns

## REPOSITORY HYGIENE

### Branch Management

**Branch Naming**:

```plaintext
# Feature branches
feature/file-output-system
feature/threading-architecture

# Bug fix branches
fix/errorholder-compatibility
fix/duplicate-output-bug

# Documentation branches
docs/cli-reference-update
docs/architecture-overview
```

**Branch Strategy**:

- Create feature branches for significant changes
- Use descriptive branch names
- Keep branches focused on single features
- Regular rebase to maintain clean history

### Merge Strategy

**Merge Commit Messages**:

```plaintext
# Good merge messages
Merge pull request #123 from feature/file-output-system

feat: implement comprehensive file output system

- Add threaded file writer with queue-based operations
- Implement observer pattern for multi-destination output
- Add CLI arguments for file output configuration
- Include comprehensive test coverage and documentation

Resolves #456, #789
```

**Quality Checks**:

- All tests pass before merge
- Documentation updated for changes
- Code review completed
- No merge conflicts

### History Preservation

**Rebase vs Merge**:

- Use rebase for feature branches to maintain linear history
- Use merge commits for significant feature integration
- Preserve context through detailed merge messages
- Avoid force-pushing to shared branches

**Tag Creation**:

Handled by CI/CD pipelines based on commit content and branch rules.

## COMMIT MESSAGE BEST PRACTICES

### Description Guidelines

**Clear and Concise**:

```plaintext
# Good
feat: add threaded file writer with queue-based operations

# Avoid
feat: add some file stuff and fix things
```

**Imperative Mood**:

```plaintext
# Good
fix: resolve threading deadlock in file writer shutdown

# Avoid
fix: resolved threading deadlock in file writer shutdown
```

**Specific and Actionable**:

```plaintext
# Good
refactor: extract observer pattern for output coordination

# Avoid
refactor: improve code structure
```

### Body Content

**When to Include Body**:

- Complex changes requiring explanation
- Breaking changes with migration notes
- Context for future developers
- References to issues or discussions

**Body Structure**:

```plaintext
feat: implement comprehensive file output system

Add threaded file writer using queue-based operations to enable
non-blocking file I/O during test execution. Implements observer
pattern for coordinating output between console and file destinations.

Key components:
- ThreadedFileWriter: Background file operations with graceful shutdown
- OutputObserver: Multi-destination output coordination
- CLI integration: Complete argument parsing and validation

Resolves #456: File output feature request
Addresses #789: Performance concerns with blocking I/O
```

### Footer Guidelines

**Breaking Changes**:

```plaintext
feat!: change file output API interface

BREAKING CHANGE: File output configuration now uses observer pattern
instead of direct formatter calls. Update existing integrations to use
new OutputObserver interface.

Migration guide: docs/migration/file-output-v2.md
```

**Issue References**:

```plaintext
fix: handle unittest _ErrorHolder objects gracefully

Resolves #123
Fixes #456
Closes #789
```

## PROJECT-SPECIFIC VARIATIONS

### Stichotrope Branching Strategy

**Context**: Stichotrope uses a milestone-based development workflow with strict quality gates at each level.

**Branch Hierarchy**:

```
main (production, v1.0.0 release only)
  └── dev (development integration branch)
      ├── milestone/<milestone-id>-<short-description>
      │   ├── task/<task-id>-<short-description>
      │   ├── task/<task-id>-<short-description>
      │   └── task/<task-id>-<short-description>
      ├── milestone/<milestone-id>-<short-description>
      │   └── ...
      └── ...
```

**Workflow Rules**:

1. **All work from `dev` branch** (not `main`)
   - `main` is production-only, receives merges only at v1.0.0 release
   - `dev` is the integration branch for all development work

2. **Milestone branches from `dev`**
   - Branch naming: `milestone/<milestone-id>-<short-description>`
   - Example: `milestone/2.1-thread-safe-architecture`
   - Created when milestone work begins
   - Deleted after merge back to `dev`

3. **Task branches from milestone branches**
   - Branch naming: `task/<task-id>-<short-description>`
   - Example: `task/2.1.1-design-architecture`
   - Created when task work begins
   - Deleted after merge back to milestone branch

4. **Merge Hierarchy**:
   - Task branches → Milestone branch (when task complete)
   - Milestone branch → `dev` (when ALL milestone tasks complete)
   - `dev` → `main` (when milestone in `dev` passes ALL tests: regression, unit, integration, performance)

5. **Merge Criteria**:
   - **Task → Milestone**: Task success gates met, task tests pass
   - **Milestone → dev**: All milestone tasks complete, all milestone tests pass, no regressions
   - **dev → main**: ALL tests pass (regression, unit, integration, performance), ready for release

6. **Conventional Commits**:
   - Follow organization's conventional commit format (see above)
   - Enables automated semantic versioning
   - Version increments: Major.Minor.Patch (see Stichotrope roadmap for details)

**Rationale**: This variation optimizes for milestone-based development with strict quality gates, ensuring each milestone is fully validated before integration into `dev`, and `dev` is production-ready before merging to `main`.

**Differences from Standard Workflow**:
- Standard: Feature branches from `main` or `develop`
- Stichotrope: Milestone branches from `dev`, task branches from milestone branches
- Standard: Single-level branching (feature → main)
- Stichotrope: Three-level branching (task → milestone → dev → main)
- Standard: Merge to main when feature complete
- Stichotrope: Merge to main only at v1.0.0 release

**Last Updated**: 2025-11-02 (Stichotrope v1.0.0 roadmap)
